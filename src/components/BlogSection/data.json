      "excerpt": "Video content has been proven to hold people's attention far longer than other forms of media. Viewers are more likely to watch videos to the end and are also more likely to remember the message, making it a great way to build brand awareness. Videos are highly shareable, which helps them reach a larger audience. Whether it's a funny clip, a touching story, or an educational tutorial, videos are one of the most shared forms of content on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Most social media algorithms prioritize video content, meaning videos often get more exposure than images or text. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook actively promote video posts, which results in more visibility, higher engagement, and greater reach for businesses using video effectively. Short-form videos, popularized by platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, are quick and engaging. These videos are often between 15-60 seconds long, capturing attention immediately and delivering bite-sized, impactful content. They're perfect for product teasers, behind-the-scenes glimpses, or quick tutorials.",
